"""Turn a `CodeNode` into the text document that actually gets embedded.

This is the highest-leverage module in the project. Get it right and the rest
works; get it wrong and no amount of model tuning rescues it.

The key decision: we do NOT embed raw source code. Raw Java is mostly syntax --
braces, modifiers, type names, boilerplate -- and a sentence embedding model
trained on English prose has no idea what to do with it. The signal that
actually connects "the system shall notify the user of nearby attractions" to
`sendAlert()` is *the words inside the identifiers*, and those words are welded
together in camelCase where no tokenizer will find them.

So we synthesise a pseudo-English document per node from:

    1. The node name, split on camelCase/snake_case ("dispatchEvent" ->
       "dispatch event")
    2. The signature (parameter names carry real domain vocabulary)
    3. Attached comments / Javadoc (already English -- the strongest signal
       available, and eTour has 864 of them)
    4. Identifiers from the body, also split
    5. The enclosing class name, split

Identifier splitting is the single highest-impact trick here. It is what turns
an embedding model that has never seen Java into a usable code retriever, and it
is why this project can use a general-purpose sentence model rather than
needing a code-specific one.

#: The four alternatives, in order, and why each is needed:
#:   [A-Z]+(?![a-z])  a run of capitals NOT followed by a lowercase letter --
#:                    this is the acronym case. "HTTPServer" must give
#:                    "HTTP" + "Server", never "H","T","T","P". The negative
#:                    lookahead is what stops the greedy run from eating the
#:                    "S" that belongs to the next word.
#:   [A-Z][a-z]*      a normal capitalised word ("Server")
#:   \d+[a-z]*        a number with an optional suffix, so "2nd" stays together
#:   [a-z]+           a plain lowercase run ("dispatch")

#: simply not being captured.
